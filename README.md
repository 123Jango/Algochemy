what are algorithms ?
An algorithm is simply a set of steps used to complete a specific task. They're the building blocks for programming, and they allow things like computers, smartphones, and websites to function and make decisions. In addition to being used by technology, a lot of things we do on a daily basis are similar to algorithms.

Qualities of a Good Algorithm
.Input and output should be defined precisely.
.Each step in the algorithm should be clear and unambiguous.
.Algorithms should be most effective among many different ways to solve a problem.
.An algorithm shouldn't include computer code. Instead, the algorithm should be written in such a way that it can be used in different programming languages.

According to me algorithm is a approach for a problem and comparing how fast one approach is than the others.For sorting algorithms the efficiency is determined by the time complexity and space complexity of the algorithm.

Time complexity refers to the time taken by an algorithm to complete its execution with respect to the size of the input. It can be represented in different forms:
.Big-O notation (O)
.Omega notation (Œ©)
.Theta notation (Œò)

Space complexity refers to the total amount of memory used by the algorithm for a complete execution. It includes both the auxiliary memory and the input.
The auxiliary memory is the additional space occupied by the algorithm apart from the input data. Usually, auxiliary memory is considered for calculating the space complexity of an algorithm.

Searching Algorithms are designed to check for an element or retrieve an element from any data structure where it is stored. Based on the type of search operation, these algorithms are generally classified into two categories:

1) Sequential Search: In this, the list or array is traversed sequentially and every element is checked. For example: Linear Search.

2) Interval Search: These algorithms are specifically designed for searching in sorted data-structures. These type of searching algorithms are much more efficient than                       Linear Search as they repeatedly target the center of the search structure and divide the search space in half. For Example: Binary Search.

Path finding algorithms build on top of graph search algorithms and explore routes between nodes, starting at one node and traversing through relationships until the destination has been reached. These algorithms find the cheapest path in terms of the number of hops or weight. Weights can be anything measured, such as time, distance, capacity, or cost.

The Shortest Path algorithm calculates the shortest (weighted) path between a pair of nodes. Shortest path is considered to be one of the classical graph problems and has been researched as far back as the 19th century. It has the following use cases:

.Finding directions between physical locations. This is the most common usage, and web mapping tools such as Google Maps use the shortest path algorithm, or a variant of it, to provide driving directions.

.Social networks can use the algorithm to find the degrees of separation between people. For example, when you view someone‚Äôs profile on LinkedIn, it will indicate how many people separate you in the connections graph, as well as listing your mutual connections.
